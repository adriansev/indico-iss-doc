# General usage documentation

INDICO - ISS is an self-hosted server of INDICO framework for event organization, archival and collaboration.  
INDICO upstream information and documentation can be found at:  

* [INDICO User manual](https://learn.getindico.io/)
* [INDICO GitHub repository](https://github.com/indico/indico)

## Management protocol 

The management of content is done hierarchically, starting with root (Home) location
and then flowing downwards (tree/leaf structure).  

The manager of a category can create structures (events/sub-categories)  
within it's area of rights and can delegate/assign management rights within this area.

### How to get access rights within another substructure (e.g. another laboratory)

If you'd like to get editing or admin rights for a page/event that belongs to another
structure (for example, a different laboratory), please contact the manager of that structure first.

!!! tip "Example"
    If you are part of Laboratory A and want to become an administrator for a page/event under Laboratory B,
    you need to have approval by e-mail from the head of Laboratory B.

Once you receive the approval, you can submit the request in Indico or ask the manager to grant you the necessary rights directly.


## User/account creation

An INDICO-ISS user have to have a contractual relation with Institute of Space Science - ISS  
The account username must have the following structure:  
`<initial of the first/chosen name><last name>`  
The e-mail address should be the official full name e-mail address:  
`<first name>.<last name>@spacescience.ro`  

In case of name/username clashes, a solution will be found through communication with the administrator.
